*Hi, I'm Ram*, Welcome to my humble space in the internet;\
I am an engineer who passionate about science and engineering, having expertise in system administration and
network engineering. I have keen interest in Maths, Physics, Computers, Electronics, Automobiles and Astronomy,
keeping up with dialy advances.

Over the years, I've been exploring and experimenting in different technologies, getting to know them. The engineering
behind the working of these technologies that drive our dialy lives really excites me to know more and more.
From Computers, we dialy use

As a person who is paronoid about his privacy and security, I maintain minimal footprint in the internet,
and I'm self-hosting all of my digital services Mail, and Cloud, in my very own homelab servers which allows
me control over my data. My homelab is my playground for experimenting with virtualization, new linux distros,
security and networking stuff. I love to mess with up with linux (a lot), tinkering it, and sometimes even breaking :),
I'm more of a hardware guy, I love messing up with kernels, embeded systems, and hardward. I prefer using FOSS stack,
every technology I ran in my laptop, homelab, and servers are running on opensource software,  limiting myself from using
proprietary software.

I have graduated Bachelors of Engineering in Information Technology from Chandigarh University.
And Actively advancing my career as system administrator and network engineer. I'm eager to go to further
studies to advance my understanding of the world, hopefully further academic exploration will help me
bridge the gap between my practical experience and cutting-edge research, enabling me to contribute
meaningfully to both the scientific community and industry.

Feel free to keep an eye on my blog posts, I've been actively maintain my blog, and going to document
all my projects, reflections, learning and findings on various technologies. Hopefully you find something
interesting and useful to you.
